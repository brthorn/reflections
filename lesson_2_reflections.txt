What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	What happens is it creates a .git folder which makes it possible to commit files.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?	

	Staging area allows the user to add specific things to be committed, while the working directory 
	has the files and their commits. It allows the user to make logical commits and see changes.
