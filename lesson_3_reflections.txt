When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	Whenever you are ready to share with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Whenever you are not on your home computer or not ready for changes in the file.
