When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	Whenever you are ready to share with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Whenever you are not on your home computer or not ready for changes in the file.\

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
		
	Forks allow a user to clone a repository straight onto GitHub, while still giving the original author credit
	and will automatically create a remote to the new forked data for the User instead of the original.
	Clones allow a person to use other's data, but the remote is still pointing to the original's work.
	Branches are made locally to branch off the master in case a person wants to try experimenting with their
	code without messing up the working master.
